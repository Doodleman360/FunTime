Instructions for setting up your local dev environment:

1. Follow Java Eclipse setup instructions here: https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/145002-installing-eclipse-c-java
2. In eclipse, select Window>Show View> Other > Git > Git Repositories
3. Select “Clone a Git Repository”
4. In the URI field, fill in our repo url: https://github.com/Doodleman360/FunTime
5. Click Next, Next again
6. Make a note of the Directory that the repo is copied to. By default it’s /Users/yourname/git/FunTime. I recommend leaving it as is. Now click finish.
7. Now close Eclipse, reopen and set your workspace to the directory in step 6(Users/yourname/git/FunTime)
8. Now select File>New>Project…>WPILib Robot Java Development > Robot Java Project
9. For project name, put in HappyLochNess. This is VERY IMPORTANT not to change the name, and capitalization matters, so just copy/paste this: HappyLochNess
10. Select “command-Based Robot”  and click Finish.
11. Now you’re ready to start programming!!!
